# barter.game

A federated mutual-credit ledger. **Be your own bank.**

Mint a personal currency — "1 logo", "1 hour of consulting", "1 home-cooked
dinner" — issued by you, signed by you, redeemable from you. Trade it with
people who know and trust you. No central authority. No middleman. Just
signed vouchers and their atomic settlement.

## The big idea

For 40+ years, every "alternative currency" attempt (LETS, time banks,
mutual credit cooperatives) has run into the same wall: bootstrap. They
needed strangers to trust each other before the system was useful, and
strangers don't.

barter.game takes the opposite stance: **trust is local — and it attaches to
the issuer, not your counterparty.** You trust the person whose promise backs
the voucher, and the bank that settles it. You do *not* have to trust whoever
is on the other side of the trade; the banks settle against signed Orders, so
that counterparty is interchangeable and usually anonymous. Strangers can
trade here safely — what the protocol declines to do is tell you whether a
promise is any good. Discovery surfaces (registries, offers, QR profiles,
voucher feeds) distribute *facts*; deciding whom to trust stays human.

See [`ETHOS.md`](./ETHOS.md) for the full set of beliefs.

## Just test it — here's how

Demo banks run live on Deno Deploy. Each bank serves a full web client:

```
https://barter-game-banks.ai-1st.deno.net/alice/ui
https://barter-game-banks.ai-1st.deno.net/bob/ui
```

1. Open a bank's `/ui`, create an identity (handle + password — the ed25519
   key is generated and encrypted **in your browser**; the bank stores only
   ciphertext).
2. Mint a voucher: "1 coffee", "1 code review" — whatever you can deliver.
3. Share your profile QR; a friend scans it, trusts you as an issuer, and
   places an order against your voucher.
4. Settle. Watch the balances: your issuer account goes negative — that's
   mutual credit. Across all accounts, every voucher sums to **zero**:

| Holder | Voucher | Bank | Balance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alice | "1 logo" | bank-alice (issuer) | **−1** (she owes it) |
| Bob   | "1 logo" | bank-alice | **+1** (he holds it) |
| Bob   | "1 hour" | bank-bob (issuer)   | **−1** (he owes it) |
| Alice | "1 hour" | bank-bob   | **+1** (she holds it) |

Machine access works too — every bank publishes its identity document:

```bash
curl https://barter-game-banks.ai-1st.deno.net/alice/barter-bank.json
```

To run everything locally and execute the test suite:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-1st/barter.game.git && cd barter.game
bun install
bun run test:all     # Bun protocol suite + the same golden vectors under Deno
deno test            # cross-runtime parity + the bank integration suite
```

End-to-end settlement checks (local bank boot, cross-bank swap, reject
cascade, settle-replay resistance) live in `apps/bank/e2e-*.ts` — see
[`apps/bank/README.md`](./apps/bank/README.md) for how to run them.

Step-by-step protocol walkthroughs — who signs what, in which order —
are in [`scenarios/`](./scenarios/), including a full
[builder-event journey](./scenarios/builder-event.md) from bank setup to
voucher feeds.

## Run your own bank — here's how

The reference bank is one Deno process serving any number of named banks
from a single Deno KV database. Each bank's key is an env var.

```bash
# 1. Generate a bank keypair
deno run apps/bank/genkey.ts        # prints BANK_ALICE_PRIV_KEY=<base58>

# 2. Run locally
BANK_ALICE_PRIV_KEY=<base58> \
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --unstable-kv apps/bank/main.ts

# 3. Look at it
curl http://localhost:8000/alice/barter-bank.json
open http://localhost:8000/alice/ui
```

Deploying to Deno Deploy is `deno deploy` with the `deploy` block already in
[`deno.json`](./deno.json); serving more banks is just more
`BANK_<NAME>_PRIV_KEY` env vars — no extra processes. Full routes, storage
key-space, configuration, and operational notes:
[`apps/bank/README.md`](./apps/bank/README.md).

You now have a bank. Tell your friends about it, and you're a tiny central
bank in a federation of exactly however many people you've invited.

## Build your own implementation — here's the protocol spec

The contract lives in [`protocol/`](./protocol/) — read it cover to cover
and you can build a bank or client in any language:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`protocol/README.md`](./protocol/README.md) | Overview: trust model, settlement model (ready → hold → settle), invariants |
| [`protocol/base.md`](./protocol/base.md) | Identity, canonical JSON (RFC 8785), `BaseDoc`, `Signature`, `Address`, RPC envelope, replay protection |
| [`protocol/bank-schema.md`](./protocol/bank-schema.md) | Document schemas (`Voucher`, `Account`, `Record`, `Order`, `Offer`, `Mandate`, `Subscription`, `Balance`) and ledger semantics |
| [`protocol/bank-rpc.md`](./protocol/bank-rpc.md) | Bank JSON-RPC methods, pagination, orchestration recipe |
| [`protocol/discovery.md`](./protocol/discovery.md) | Finding banks, vouchers, issuers, offers, and public holdings |
| [`protocol/post-feed.md`](./protocol/post-feed.md) | Voucher-anchored post feeds (nostr-like publishing) |

The protocol only covers what interoperability needs. Everything else —
runtime, storage, UI, keypair management — is your choice. The reference
implementation documents its own choices per package:
[`packages/protocol/`](./packages/protocol/README.md) (shared primitives —
port its canonicalizer and validate against the golden vectors),
[`apps/bank/`](./apps/bank/README.md) (Deno bank server), and
[`apps/web/`](./apps/web/README.md) (browser SPA).

## Tests

```bash
bun run test        # protocol library under Bun
bun run test:deno   # SAME golden vectors under Deno (cross-runtime parity)
bun run test:all    # both
deno test           # parity vectors + the bank integration suite (deno.json test.include)
```

Cross-runtime canonicalization parity is the load-bearing invariant: if two
runtimes disagree on one canonical byte, every signature in the federation
becomes unverifiable. Details in
[`packages/protocol/README.md`](./packages/protocol/README.md).

## Honest limitations

- **No protocol-level rollback.** After a lead bank settles, an abandoning
  follower means the lead is out. Recourse is social — see
  [`ETHOS.md`](./ETHOS.md) §8.
- **No key recovery, no key rotation.** Lose the key and the password,
  lose the account.
- **No reputation, no dispute resolution.** The protocol records; humans
  adjudicate.
- The v1.5+ roadmap, including the gaps we know about, is in
  [`TODOS.md`](./TODOS.md).

## Contributing

This is early. The protocol is small enough to keep in your head. If you
find a bug, a mismatch between the spec and the code, or a place where the
ETHOS got compromised — open an issue, and bring receipts.
